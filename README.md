# Weather-Application-PUBLIC

A weather application that shows weather data for cities such as current weather, 48 hour forecasts, 7 day forecasts, and more.

This app uses four API's: <br>
1. <a href="https://openweathermap.org/">OpenWeatherMap</a> API. This is the predominant API used and provides almost all of the data shown. <br>
2. <a href="https://www.breezometer.com/">BreezoMeter</a> API. This is a great API that I use for showing air quality data. <br>
3. <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/autocomplete">Google.</a> I use their Places API, specifically the autocomplete tool, in the search bar to help select a city. <br>
4. <a href="https://ipwhois.io/">IpWhoIs.</a> This API is used to retrieve the users public IP address, it then turns that into latitude and longitude coordinates to display the weather for their current city when they first load the site. <br>
